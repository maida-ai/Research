# 1) Long-term = State space, Short-term = Transformer

**Why this makes sense:**
Modern SSMs (e.g., **Mamba** selective SSMs; **RetNet**'s retention) give linear-time sequence modeling with strong long-range behavior, but they're weaker at precise, content-based lookup that attention excels at. A **hybrid block** that routes recent tokens through attention and distant context through a recurrent SSM channel matches the empirical sweet spot: attention for local, token-precise reasoning; SSM for stable, compressive memory over long horizons. ([arXiv][1])

**How to instantiate (block-level design):**

* **Dual-path block (parallel):**

  * **Local path (attention):** masked local attention over the most recent (W) tokens (FlashAttention for efficiency during training).
  * **Global path (SSM):** a recurrent SSM state (\mathbf{s}_t) updated per token chunk; outputs a low-frequency summary.
  * **Fusion:** gated mixing (learned gate or FiLM) of attention output and SSM output; optionally cross-attend queries to the SSM state (1–4 “global tokens” to probe the state). This echoes **Infini-attention**'s “local exact + long-range cheap” idea but replaces linear attention/compressive memory with an SSM state. ([arXiv][2])
* **Training losses for stability:**

  * **Predictive auxiliary on the SSM stream** (as in **Compressive Transformer**'s reconstruction loss) to keep the “blur” predictive rather than degenerately smooth.
  * Optional **state distillation** where attention's summary is matched by the SSM head. ([arXiv][3])
* **Routing policy:**

  * Route *all* tokens through both paths, but **backprop scale** or **gates** bias recent tokens to attention and older ones to SSM. This avoids hard switches and lets the model learn usage.
* **Exact-recall safety valve:**

  * Keep a few **global tokens** (as in **BigBird/Longformer** families) or add a small **latent bottleneck** (Perceiver-style) to support verbatim recall when needed—important for code/math. ([arXiv][4])

**Why not “SSM only”?**
Even strong SSMs like **Mamba** still trail attention for discrete, content-addressed reasoning without selectivity tricks; your split lets each mechanism do what it's best at. ([arXiv][5])

**Engineering notes:**

* The SSM path keeps **O(d)** state (per head or per layer), not **O(Ld)** KV caches, so **inference memory stays flat** as context grows.
* Attention path can use a sliding window (W) (plus a tiny set of “sink” tokens shown to stabilize long streaming) to keep cost bounded. ([arXiv][6])

# 2) Block-local attention with a **per-block state vector**

Your idea—each block maintains its own recurrent state—is very close to **chunkwise recurrent** forms of RetNet and hybrid RNN/Transformer work (e.g., **RWKV**-inspired hybrids). It's also compatible with hierarchical attention like **H-Transformer-1D** if you want multiscale summaries. ([arXiv][4])

**Concrete design:**

* **Partition** a length-(L) sequence into (k) chunks of length (L/k).
* Within chunk (i), run **exact local attention** (fast with FlashAttention), and **update a learned state** (\mathbf{h}^{(\ell)}_i) for each layer (\ell).
* When you move to chunk (i{+}1), **initialize** that chunk's processing with (\mathbf{h}^{(\ell)}_i) (skip or low-rank cross-attend to it). This is akin to “carryover” memory in chunkwise RetNet and Transformer-XL-like recurrence, but cheaper than carrying full KVs. ([arXiv][4])
* **Cross-chunk mixing:**

  * To avoid “information islands,” add **(a)** periodic *shifted chunking*, **(b)** a tiny number of **global tokens**, or **(c)** a small **latent array** that each chunk cross-attends to (Perceiver IO pattern). These give you the (O(L^2/k)) win without losing global coherence. ([arXiv][4])
* **Complexity:**

  * Intra-chunk attention: (k\cdot(L/k)^2 = O(L^2/k)).
  * Cross-chunk state passing: (O(kd)) per layer (negligible).
  * Optional latent/global mixing: (O(kd m)) where (m) is small (e.g., 8–32).

**What this buys you vs. classic local attention:**
You replace the fragile “hope information hops across windows” dynamic with an **explicit recurrent conduit** per layer, which empirically stabilizes very long contexts (cf. chunkwise RetNet). ([arXiv][4])

## Pitfalls & how to address them

* **State drift / forgetting:** SSM and per-block states can drift over millions of tokens.

  * Use **gated updates** (selective SSMs in **Mamba**); add **periodic normalization or resets** on chunk boundaries; and monitor long-horizon validation where drift shows up first. ([arXiv][1])
* **Exact quoting / code fidelity:** Add **global tokens** or a **tiny retrieval memory** (kNN/associative) for rare verbatim needs; keep evaluations that test quote-back and cross-file code references. (Related findings across BigBird/Perceiver/RWKV literatures.) ([arXiv][4])
* **Integration debt:** Make the SSM path **parallelizable during training** (RetNet's parallel form; Mamba's hardware-aware parallel algorithm), so you don't pay RNN-like slowdowns. ([arXiv][4])
* **Over-compressing hurts quality:** Evidence from **Infini-attention** and follow-ups suggests too-aggressive compression degrades performance; let your SSM capacity scale modestly with model size and keep a short exact-attention window. ([Hugging Face][7])

## Suggested ablations (to make the paper compelling)

1. **Where is the state?** SSM **values** only vs. full hidden states vs. keys+values summaries.
2. **Chunking strategy:** plain vs. shifted vs. latent/global mixing; measure cross-chunk information flow.
3. **Window size (W)** and **SSM capacity** (state dim, order).
4. **Reset schedule:** never vs. periodic vs. data-driven resets.
5. **Losses:** with/without compressive reconstruction on the global path (Compressive-style). ([arXiv][3])

## Evaluation plan (focused on hybrid wins)

* **Streaming stability & infinite-length tests:** replicate **StreamingLLM**-style analyses (quality vs. length curves), show no drift up to millions of tokens. ([arXiv][6])
* **Long-range retrieval & book-level tasks:** as in **Infini-attention** (e.g., passkey retrieval, book QA/summarization). ([arXiv][2])
* **Exact recall stress tests:** code tasks and quote-back benchmarks to ensure your global/latent valve works.
* **System metrics:** memory footprint of KV vs. SSM state, HBM traffic, and throughput; report FlashAttention + chunkwise parallelism to show wall-clock wins. (RetNet shows parallel and chunkwise modes; FlashAttention covers intra-chunk.) ([arXiv][4])

## Positioning / naming

* **Method name:** *Dual-Path Attention-SSM with Chunkwise State* (DP-ASSM).
* **One-sentence pitch:** *“Dense local attention for precise reasoning, state-space memory for infinite context, and lightweight per-block states to bridge chunks—achieving long-range coherence at bounded cost.”*
* **Related-work anchors:** Compressive Transformer (compression + auxiliary loss), Infini-attention (local exact + cheap global), RetNet (chunkwise/parallel recurrence), Mamba (selective SSMs), H-Transformer-1D (hierarchical multiscale). ([arXiv][3])
