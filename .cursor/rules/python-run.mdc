description: When running python commands

- To run python commands use `uv run`
    - Python: `uv run python`
    - Pytests: `uv run pytest`
    - ...
- When running coverage tests:
    - `coverage` tool imports modules twice, which might cause issues
    - For example, if running coverage that includes pytorch, running coverage on specific files will cause pytorch to fail.
    - To fix, run `uv run pytest --cov` to cover everything (avoid running `uv run pytest --cov=some.module.path` as it will break pytorch)
